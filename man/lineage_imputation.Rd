\usage{
lineage_imputation(
  cell_features,
  cell_lineage,
  coefficient_initial_list,
  lineage_future_count,
  lambda = 0,
  random_initializations = 10,
  upper_randomness = 5,
  verbose = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_features}{A numeric matrix where each row represents a cell, and each 
column represents a feature (for instance, the fastTopics scores). 
Let \code{n} denote the number of cells (rows). 
Please ensure there are row names for \code{cell_features} (denoting the 
cell IDs), and column names (denoting the feature names).}

\item{cell_lineage}{A character or factor vector of length \code{n} where 
element \code{i} of \code{cell_lineage} denotes which lineage cell \code{i}
belongs to.}

\item{coefficient_initial_list}{A numeric vector or list of numeric vectors
of starting coefficients (names should match feature names; \code{Intercept} added if missing).}

\item{lineage_future_count}{A named numeric vector (where the names are the
lineage names that appeared in \code{cell_lineage}) that denotes the
number of cells at the future timepoint for each lineage.}

\item{lambda}{Ridge penalty weight on non-intercept coefficients.}

\item{random_initializations}{Number of additional random starts.}

\item{upper_randomness}{Upper cap for random initial coefficients.}

\item{verbose}{A numeric, where numbers larger than 1 successively request more 
information to be printed out as the algorithm proceeds.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"lineage_imputation"} with \code{fit} and \code{res_list}.
