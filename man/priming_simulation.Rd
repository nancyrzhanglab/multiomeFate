\title{Priming simulation dataset}
\format{
A named list with four elements:
\describe{
  \item{cell_features}{Numeric matrix of size \eqn{n \times p}.
    Rows are cells (rownames formatted as \code{"cell:1"}, \code{"cell:2"}, ...).
    Columns are preprocessed expression-derived features (no intercept column;
    modeling functions add it internally). No missing values.}

  \item{cell_lineage}{Character vector of length \eqn{n} giving each cell's
    lineage label used for training/evaluation.}

  \item{lineage_future_count}{Named numeric vector (length = 15). Names are
    lineage IDs matching \code{unique(cell_lineage)}. Each value is an integer
    equal to the rounded sum of per-cell expected progenies
    (i.e., \eqn{\sum_{i \in \ell} \exp(\alpha + x_i^\top \beta)}).}

  \item{tab_mat}{Integer matrix with 15 rows and 2 columns \code{c("now","future")};
    rownames are lineage IDs. Column \code{"now"} is the number of current
    cells observed in that lineage (in this subset); column \code{"future"}
    equals \code{lineage_future_count}.}
}

\description{
A small, fully synthetic dataset used to demonstrate and test lineage-fate
imputation in a **priming** setting, where cells at an early time point
possess heterogeneous growth potential (fate propensity) and downstream
lineage sizes scale with \eqn{\exp(\alpha + X\beta)}.

The dataset was reduced to **15 lineages** for a fast example.

\details{
Priming simulation dataset (15 lineages)


\strong{How this dataset was generated (summary).}

\enumerate{
\item Loaded example embeddings via \code{multiomeFate:::data_loader("fasttopics")};
  used the \code{"fasttopic.COCL2"} cell embeddings as an early-timepoint RNA
  feature space and preprocessed them with an internal helper
  \code{.preprocess_rna(…, "day10_COCL2")}.

\item Estimated a priming direction and intercept using internal helpers:
  \code{.search_for_priming_parameters()} returned \code{coefficient_vec}
  and \code{coefficient_intercept}. The intercept was decreased in small steps
  until the expected total number of descendants across all cells matched a
  target size (chosen from a later timepoint, e.g. \code{"week5_COCL2"}), using
  \code{.compute_mean_total_cells()}.

\item Assigned cells to lineages with \code{.assign_lineages_priming()},
  simulating exponential clonal expansion over multiple rounds. The per-cell
  fate potential was \eqn{\log_{10} \exp(\alpha + x^\top \beta)}.
  Cells were grouped into lineages by quantiles of this log10 potential;
  lineage future sizes were the rounded sums of \eqn{\exp(\alpha + x^\top \beta)}
  within each lineage.

\item For packaging, lineages were ranked by future size; 15 lineages were
  retained by taking equally spaced ranks along this ordering. Cells not
  belonging to the retained lineages were dropped. Cell rownames were reset to
  \code{"cell:1..n"} for clarity. The four objects in \code{priming_simulation}
  were then assembled as below and saved with \code{usethis::use_data()}:

  \preformatted{
  priming_simulation <- list(
    cell_features = embedding_mat_subset,
    cell_lineage = as.character(lineage_assignment_subset),
    lineage_future_count = lineage_future_size_subset,
    tab_mat = cbind(now = table(lineage_assignment_subset)[names(lineage_future_size_subset)],
                    future = lineage_future_size_subset)
  )
  }
}

\strong{Intended use.}
\itemize{
  \item Quick-start examples for \code{\link{lineage_cv}},
    \code{\link{lineage_cv_finalize}}, and \code{\link{lineage_imputation_sequence}}.
  \item Unit tests where a small but structured dataset is helpful.
}

\strong{Notes.}
\itemize{
  \item An intercept column is \emph{not} present in \code{cell_features}; modeling
        functions add it automatically where required.
  \item The data are \emph{fully synthetic} and derived from internal simulation helpers;
        no real subject-level outcomes are included.
